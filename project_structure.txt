# PROJECT GOAL: Fortnite Video Software
# TARGET: PYTHON / DESKTOP (GPU-ENABLED)
# ==============================================================================
A quick, free-to-use, ad-free, GPU-accelerated desktop video editor designed for creating and sharing cool Fortnite video clips with family and friends.
The suite is divided into four main applications: Video Compressor, Video Merger, Crop Tool, and an Advanced Video Editor.

# General Project Guidelines:
# 1. To maintain readability and focus, each code/script file should not exceed 150-200 lines. Logic should be divided into multiple separate files.
# 2. This file (.\project_structure.txt) must be kept up-to-date, reflecting all changes in the project structure.
# 3. Video tempo and audio pitch scale with the speed multiplier, but background music tempo remains constant.
# 4. To ensure dialogue and in-game sounds are clear, the main video's audio is protected using "Volume Ducking" and "EQ Ducking" against the background music.
#    - Volume Ducking: When the main audio exceeds -16.5 dB (a threshold of 0.15), the background music volume is compressed at a 2.5:1 ratio.
#    - EQ Ducking: The music is split at 150 Hz. Ducking is applied only to frequencies above 150 Hz, preserving the music's bassline while carving out space for the main audio.
# 5. Code should be written without comments for a clean and uncluttered codebase.

# Manual Pip Management:
# To upgrade pip: "%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Python\Python313\python.exe" -m pip install --upgrade pip
# To install packages: "%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Python\Python313\python.exe" -m pip install PyQt5 psutil python-vlc send2trash
