# Project Goal and description:
a quick video gpu based software editor which is free of use, free of advertisement, yet quick to create an easy to share Fortnite cool video clips with family or friends.
The app is devided into 4 different parts/apps: Video Compressor, Video Merger, Crop Tool, and Advanced Video Editor.

# General Project Guidelines:
1. Each code/script file, should never exceed 150 - 170 lines of code max per file. if 150 lines should exceeded devide the code into multiple file in such way that eventually no file exceed 150 - 170 lines of code.
2. While working on the app/files of this project, if you see a miss information or any update in the file structure/role/parts please on the fly update it here in the .\project_structure.txt file accordinly.
3. Video tempo and sound of the original video temp changes according to the speed multiplier(Preview of the video changes accord as well), however, background music NEVER changes tempo/rythm.
