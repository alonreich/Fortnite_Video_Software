[1] TEST FILE: sanity_tests/test_core_01_constant_tempo_dryrun.py
    Timestamp: 2026-02-18 17:28:58 Jerusalem Standard Time+0200
    File Status: SUCCEEDED
    Counts: passed=1 | failed=0 | skipped=0
    Purpose: source-contract dryrun. This file validates that critical logic snippets/API wiring still exist in code after refactors.
    1. Title: test_core_01_constant_tempo_dryrun
       Status: SUCCEEDED
       Test Scenario (Detailed): Core 01 constant tempo dryrun
       Expected Behavior: The tested scenario should complete successfully: Core 01 constant tempo dryrun.
       Why This Is Expected: Dryrun tests protect code contracts against silent refactors. If the expected snippets disappear/rename, runtime behavior can drift without immediate visibility.
       Actual Behavior: Observed result: all assertions/conditions in this test passed exactly as expected.
       Expected vs Actual: No gap detected; expected and observed behavior are aligned.
       Result Explanation: Scenario executed correctly and all checks aligned with the expected contract.
